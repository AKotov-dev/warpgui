+ RPM packages for Mageia-9

v2.1
+ warp-cli: the "register" command deprecated; "registration new" instead

**Note:** Around March 2024, Cloudflare (TM) WARP in Russia may be permanently blocked. It is highly recommended to switch to the XTLS-Reality protocol and use [XRayGUI](https://github.com/AKotov-dev/XRayGUI) - for individual protection or to [SocksGW](https://github.com/AKotov-dev/SocksGW) - to protect your families. Good luck.

v1.9
+ Fixing /bin/warp-update
+ Packages for Mageia-8/9

**Note:** After updating the package, don't forget to update `cloudflare-warp` (F2 key in `warpgui` window)

I remind you, if registration is not possible in your country (status: `registration attempt...`), close `warpgui`, start any VPN, open `warpgui` and wait 3-5 seconds. If there is no connection after registration (status: `waiting for connection...`), press [F12] sequentially, with an interval of 3-5 seconds, until the connection is established. Good luck.
